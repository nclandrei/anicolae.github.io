Hello! I'm Andrei-Mihai Nicolae, a senior programmer from Bucharest, Romania. I am primarily building web applications, with a deep passion for Clojure(script) and Ruby (on Rails).

I also have extensive experience with Javascript, Go, Java, React and Angular.

Aside from programming, I love music and playing the piano, Baduk, writing, reading, playing tennis and football, doing carpentry and photography.

I'm currently working remotely as a senior programmer at Carta.

You can always say hi at [hello@anicolae.ro](mailto:hello@anicolae.ro)!
