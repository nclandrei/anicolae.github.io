Hello! I'm Andrei-Mihai Nicolae, a senior programmer from Bucharest, Romania. I am primarily doing web development, with 
a deep passion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

I also have extensive experience with Javascript, Go, Java, React and Angular.

Aside from programming, I like playing the piano, writing, reading, car racing, playing tennis and football, doing carpentry and photography.

I'm currently working remotely as a senior software engineer at Carta.

You can always say hi at [contact@anicolae.ro](mailto:contact@anicolae.ro)!
